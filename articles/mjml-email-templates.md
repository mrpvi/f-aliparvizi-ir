# MJML: Making Email Development Easy

Email development has always been challenging due to inconsistent support across different email clients. MJML (Mailjet Markup Language) solves this problem by providing a semantic syntax that makes responsive email easy.

## The Problem with Email HTML

Traditional email development involves:

- Writing table-based layouts
- Dealing with inconsistent CSS support
- Testing across multiple email clients
- Handling responsive design manually

## What is MJML?

MJML is a markup language designed to reduce the pain of coding responsive emails. It uses a semantic syntax and compiles to responsive HTML.

### Basic MJML Structure

```xml
<mjml>
  <mj-head>
    <mj-title>My Email Title</mj-title>
  </mj-head>
  <mj-body>
    <mj-section>
      <mj-column>
        <mj-text>Hello World!</mj-text>
      </mj-column>
    </mj-section>
  </mj-body>
</mjml>
```

## Key Features

### 1. Semantic Components

MJML provides semantic components that handle the complexity:

- `<mj-section>` - Sections are the building blocks
- `<mj-column>` - Columns within sections
- `<mj-text>` - Text content
- `<mj-button>` - Call-to-action buttons
- `<mj-image>` - Responsive images

### 2. Responsive by Default

All MJML components are mobile-responsive out of the box:

```xml
<mj-section>
  <mj-column width="33.33%">
    <mj-text>Column 1</mj-text>
  </mj-column>
  <mj-column width="33.33%">
    <mj-text>Column 2</mj-text>
  </mj-column>
  <mj-column width="33.33%">
    <mj-text>Column 3</mj-text>
  </mj-column>
</mj-section>
```

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   npm install mjml
   ```

2. **Create your first template**
   ```xml
   <mjml>
     <mj-body>
       <mj-section>
         <mj-column>
           <mj-text font-size="20px" color="#F45E43">
             Welcome to MJML!
           </mj-text>
         </mj-column>
       </mj-section>
     </mj-body>
   </mjml>
   ```

3. **Compile to HTML**
   ```bash
   mjml template.mjml -o template.html
   ```

## Best Practices

- **Keep it simple**: Use MJML's semantic approach
- **Test thoroughly**: Always test across different email clients
- **Optimize images**: Use web-optimized images with alt text
- **Use fallbacks**: Provide fallback content for unsupported features

## Conclusion

MJML significantly simplifies responsive email development by abstracting away the complexity of email HTML. It's an essential tool for anyone serious about email marketing or transactional emails.
